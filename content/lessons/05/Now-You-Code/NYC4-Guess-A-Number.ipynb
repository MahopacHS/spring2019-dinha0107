Whenever you guess, the computer will\ngive you a hint of higher or lower. This process repeats until you guess\nthe number, after which the computer reports the number of guesses it took you.\n\nFor Example:\n\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...\nYour guess: 5\nToo low. Guess higher.\nYour guess: 7\nToo high. Guess lower.\nYour guess: 6\nYou guessed it in 3 tries.\n\nYour loop should continue until your input guess equals the\ncomputer generated random number.\n\n### How do you make Python generate a random number?
