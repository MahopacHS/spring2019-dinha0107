One of the many notable scenes involves a character Indigo Montoya who explains his character's motivation for revenge through the catch-phase:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nYou can watch the clip here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY4cnMmo9qw)\n\nWrite a program in Python which asks the user to enter **your name**, a **relative** and an **past-tense action**. For example if you enter \"Indigo Montoya\", \"Father\" and \"killed\", the program will then output:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Indigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nOr you could input \"Mike Fudge\", \"Uncle\" and \"Tickled\" to get:\n\n\"Hello. My name is Mike Fudge. You Tickled my Uncle. Prepare to die!\"\n"
